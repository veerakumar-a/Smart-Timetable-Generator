Smart Timetable Generator is an AI-powered, credit-based timetable creator that automatically schedules classes for schools and colleges. It is built using Python and Tkinter with a colorful and easy-to-use interface.

The system uses smart logic to assign subjects, teachers, rooms, and credits efficiently. It supports automatic period allocation based on credits (1 credit = 3 periods, 3 credits = 5 periods, 4 credits = 7 periods). For lab subjects, it automatically assigns two continuous periods. It also detects and prevents teacher or room conflicts in real time.

Users can drag and drop subjects to adjust the timetable easily. The interface includes smooth animations, a live progress bar, and options to export the timetable as Excel or PDF files.

This project is simple to use, error-free, and designed to make timetable creation faster and smarter. It’s perfect for schools, colleges, and academic institutions that want to automate scheduling with an advanced yet user-friendly tool.
